# 3D Portfolio (React Three Fiber)

This is a 3D developer portfolio project built with **React Three Fiber**, designed as a learning exercise and technical study. The project replicates a 3D portfolio originally shown in a tutorial, with the goal of understanding how to work with 3D models and interactive elements within a React environment.
